Hi students A, I strongly support your idea, and brave to do it ,The best way to learn is to practice, we can learn a lot of knowledges by teaching our friends , when our friends ask us some questions that we don't know the answer, we can discuss  with our friends, and we can learn more.

## Scenario 4: It's just too much
* answer        
Nanodegree programs can be challenging. and running into issues and feeling lost is normal. Everyone, even the most experienced people, make mistakes and get stuck sometimes.
I might be able to help you. It's often helpful to start approaching tricky questions by thinking about what information you already have that might be relevant. What do we already know that could be helpful?

* thought process      
Encourage the students and guide the students to connect knowledge points ,give the right way to solve problem.

## Scenario 5: Unsupportive Support
* answer       
I am so sorry for the problem you mentioned, The reason why we did not tell you the answer is for you to really grasp the knowledge, When you solve the problem by yourself this time, next time you encounter a similar problem, you can quickly resolve it. Maybe you do not understand our practice for a while, but when you finish the course you will understand why we did it. Let's figure it out together! Could you tell me what’s challenging you right now?

* thought process       
Appease the students' negative emotions, tell students the reason why we didn't tell him the answer and the benefits to solve the probles by himsels. guide the students tell me the Specific difficulties faced 

## Scenario 6: Margot's Strawberries
### Part 1:
* answer        
Hi, that's ok that you don't know where to start. Word problems can be tricky! I suggest you first start by writing down, in your own words, what you know from the problem.
For example, _"Margot loves strawberries and wants to buy as many as she can with the $ 8 she has in her pocket"_  _tell us that 8$ is the maximum we have to work with._ Can you tell us what else we know about the previous statement?

* thought process        
I want to give the student a chance to start on the right track, so I give them an example sentence and showed them how I broke the problem down. I then ask a follow up question to see if the student understand my process and ask them to extract more information from the second part of my example sentence.

### Part 2:
* answer        
Hi, You are on the right way, according to all constraints we had gathered from the problem statement. we can start like this. For Example, "_we have constraints like this, x = 3, x * y = 6, we can get the y = 6 / x"_, Can you tell us what can you do from the constraints you listed? 

* thought process      
I want to tell the student what will do next, so I give them an example sentence and showed them how can we get some information from constraints, I then ask a follow up question to see if the student understand my process and ask them to do the similar thing from the constraints they listed? 
### Part 3:
* answer     
You're so close to the solution! Congratulations! but note the hint in the exercise.
